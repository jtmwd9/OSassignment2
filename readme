OS Assignment 2

To compile:
	$make runsim
	$make testsim

	THERE WILL BE WARNINGS. I was going to try to fix them, but I ran out of time. Try to ignore them pls

To run:
	$./runsim [int] <[testfile]
		int: number of 'licenses' you would like to allow. Defaults to 10.

I tried to use queue for the licenses, but after an hour or so of frustration I realized that you can't do that with shared memory because you have to know how big shared memory be.

FOR TESTING:
	I assume that your testing files will be in the same format as the example so I hard coded "./" to each call for testsim
